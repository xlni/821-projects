\section{Introduction}

The \emph{Fourier transform} takes a function $f:\R\to\C$ and produces another
function, $\Phi(f):\R\to\C$, via the following integral transform:
\[ \Phi(f)(\lambda) = \int_\R e^{-2\pi i x \lambda} f(x)\, dx. \]
Conceptually, this takes a \emph{frequency} $\lambda$, which determines the ``pure sinusoid''
$e^{-2\pi i x \lambda}$, and convolves it with $f$ to extract the \emph{amplitude} of $f$ 
at that frequency. This is especially clear when $f$ represents a wave, such as an alternating
current through time or a quantum mechanical wavefunction. 

The Fourier transform generalizes to higher dimensions, too. If we now have a function
$f:\R^n\to\C$, we can express the pure sinusoid associated to $\lambda\in\R^n$ by 
$e^{-2\pi i x\cdot\lambda}$ (note the dot product). For a general real vector space $V$, where
we still have a notion of integration, it might be more natural to define the 
Fourier transform as a function from the dual, $V^* \to \C$, given by
\[ \Phi(f)(\lambda) = \int_\R e^{-2\pi i \lambda(x)} f(x)\, dx. \]
This is the same transform described for $\R^n$; every linear functional from $\R^n$ is
just given by a dot product. In all of the cases outlined above, a pure sinusoid, or
\emph{character}, sends addition to multiplication. In fact, it's a group homomorphism 
$\lambda:V \to \C^\times$, where we require that $|\lambda(x)| = 1$ for all $x\in V$.

In fact, we don't need to stick to real analysis to preform Fourier transforms; they're
valid wherever we have a notion of \emph{characters}
and \emph{integration}. A familiar object with both of these properties is the finite field
$\F_p$, as we will show. Our choice of integration is easy: given any $f:\F_p\to\C$, we define
\[ \int_{\F_p} f(x)\, dx = \sum_{x\in\F_p} f(x). \]
It's a linear map, and respects translation: $f(x + n)$, $n$ fixed, integrates to the 
same value as $f(x)$. Characters require just a bit more thinking: to give a character 
$\lambda$, we need to give a complex number whose $p$th power is $1$, that is, we need
to chose a root of unity. So we have a formula for the set of characters:
\[ \lambda(x) = \exp {\frac{2\pi i}{p} x \lambda}, \]
where we've identified the character $\lambda$ with the element $\lambda\in\F_p$, by
abuse of notation. Applying a generalization like for $\R^n$, we can define a general
finite Fourier transform.
\begin{defn}
    Let $V$ be any $\F_p$-vector space, and $f:V\to \C$ be any function. The Fourier
    transform is a function $\Phi(f):V^*\to\C$, defined on the dual space, given by
    \[ \Phi(f)(\lambda) = 
        \sum_{x\in\F_p} \exp \left(\frac{2\pi i}{p} \lambda(x)\right) f(x). \]
\end{defn}

Our goal is to explore this transform. We will study \emph{indicator functions}; for
some fixed $\F_p$-vector space $V$, and a subset $S\subset V$, define
\[ \IND_S(x) = \begin{cases}
    1 & x \in V \\
    0 & \text{otherwise}     
\end{cases} \]
In this situation, the Fourier transform is somewhat simpler, and is entirely
determined by what a functional $\lambda$ does on the subset $S$.
\[ \Phi(\IND_S)(\lambda) = \sum_{x\in S} \exp \left(\frac{2\pi i}{p} \lambda(x)\right). \]
