\section{Homogeneous polynomials in 2 variables}\label{sec:part2}
In the preceding section, we considered degree $2$ homogeneous polynomials in $n$ variables. Now we will instead consider degree $n$ homogeneous polynomials in $2$ variables. However, we will set things up quite differently.

Let $\F_p[x,y]_n$ denote the space of homogeneous polynomials of degree $n$ over $\F_p$. It is an $(n+1)$-dimensional vector space, spanned by the basis elements
\[
	\{x^n, x^{n-1}y, \ldots, xy^{n-1}, y^n\}.
\]
Now define $V$ to be the dual space of this vector space:
\[
	V \coloneqq \left(\F_p[x,y]_n\right)^*.
\]
Of particular algebraic interest are the elements of $V$ which are given by \emph{evaluation}---these are the functionals of the form
\[
	\F_p[x,y]_n \ni P \mapsto P(a,b) \in \F_p
\]
for some $a,b\in \F_p$. However, this set is not conical for $n>1$. So we will instead let $S$ be the set
\[
	S=\{\xi_{a,b,c} \in V \mid \xi_{a,b,c}(P) = cP(a,b)\}.
\]
The Fourier transform of $\IND_S$ will be a $\C$-valued function on $V^*$, which is the double dual of $\F_p[x,y]_n$. Since $\F_p[x,y]_n$ is finite dimensional, it is canonically isomorphic to its double dual, so we will identify $V^* = \F_p[x,y]_n$.
