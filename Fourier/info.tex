\section*{info}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[Xianglong] This section will serve as a place for us to write general comments. (Of course, it will be omitted from submissions.) Currently I am working on Appendix A.

    \item[Oron] The end of the section on nilpotent matrices is still under construction.
    
    \item[Xianglong] It would be good to put
    \[
    	\Phi(\IND_S)(\lambda) = \frac{p|S \cap \ker \lambda| - |S|}{p-1}
    \]
    somewhere. In fact, \textcolor{red}{Miguel}, I think that it would be good to focus on deriving this in your warmup section (rather than problem (0) specifically). Problem (0) should follow immediately from this anyway, and this is more useful for the later sections.
\end{itemize}
