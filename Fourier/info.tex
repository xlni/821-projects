\section*{info}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[Xianglong] This section will serve as a place for us to write general comments. (Of course, it will be omitted from submissions.)

    \item[Oron] The end of the section on nilpotent matrices is still under construction.
    
    \item[Xianglong] Updated notation for FT (replace $\Phi(-)$ by $\widehat{-}$) and functionals (replace $\lambda$ by $\xi$). Hopefully I didn't screw up anything. Still need to add connecting narrative
\end{itemize}
